# Simple Chat Tool

This is a project made for Grundlagen der Programmierung at FH Campus Wien by:

- Florian Panek
- Patrick Schwarzl
- Navdeep Singh
- Anastasiya Urusova
- Hugo Hernán Vergara Vásquez

## Aim of the project

This is a simple application created in Java that provides communication between multiple clients in a GUI created with JavaFX. The connection can be established with the help of the Server class (localhost), or by entering some other reachable host address in the login window. By default, the server listens on the port 5056; therefore, in case of using some other address, an appropriate port number must be provided as well. A check if the entered hostname is actually online is conducted automatically on login.

## How to use

Please note that there are two versions of this application available:
- **Version without GUI** (the "ClientWithoutGui" branch: https://github.com/fpanek/SimpleChatTool/tree/ClientWithoutGUI)
- **Version with GUI** that has been updated on 16th January (the Master branch)

Since the GUI version update, please use this version of the program from Master branch.

1. Start Server.java
2. Start Client.java
3. Enter hostname and the desired username (port is optional)
4. You can start chatting immediately
